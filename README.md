# SCVLM

This is the **official code repository** for **Make VLMs Memorize Normality: Sparsity-Controllable Vision-Language Model for Video Anomaly Detection**.

## 🔍 Introduction

SCVLM is a vision-language model designed for multimodal anomaly detection.

This repository currently provides evaluation code for measuring model performance.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Make sure all dependencies in eval.py are installed, then run the following command to evaluate the model:

```bash
python eval.py
```

## 📌 Full Code

The full development code will be released after the paper is accepted.
